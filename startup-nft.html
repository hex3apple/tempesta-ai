    <h1>STARTUP MONETIZES SANDWICH BITES AS NFTS 2.0; INVESTORS EAT IT UP</h1>

    <p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, CA</strong> — In the latest evolution of late-stage capitalism, Silicon Valley startup BiteChain has unveiled NFTs 2.0 — a next-gen marketplace where users can buy and trade digital representations of actual bites taken from sandwiches. Yes, you read that right. No, we’re not sure either.</p>
    <p>The company calls them B.A.A.S. (Bites As A Service™) and claims it’s revolutionizing both lunch and ownership.</p>
    <p>“This isn’t just about food,” said founder Theo Crunch, who wore three hoodies and the expression of someone who hasn’t slept since Dogecoin peaked. “It’s about experiencing the essence of a bite. The mouthfeel. The memory. The moment. We’ve digitized it.”</p>
    <h3>The Platform</h3>
    <p>Users upload pictures of their sandwich bites, which are then “immortalized” on the blockchain using BiteChain’s proprietary flavor-hashing algorithm. Each bite is tagged with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Type of sandwich (e.g., “Artisanal Turkey Pesto on Sourdough”)</li>
      <li>Bite angle (obtuse bites trade for higher value)</li>
      <li>Crumb density</li>
      <li>Emotional intention behind the chew</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You don’t own the sandwich. You don’t eat the sandwich.<br>You own the vibe of having bitten it.</p>
    <h3>Investors Are All In</h3>
    <p>Venture capitalists threw $110 million at BiteChain before the app even had a Terms of Service. “We love businesses that don't make sense but sound disruptive in a pitch deck,” said VC Kevin D’Angelo while eating a sandwich he cannot afford to mint.</p>
    <p>Applebee’s has already joined the pilot program, offering limited-edition bites of their “Triple Bacon Rodeo Crunch Wrap” as part of their “Late Capitalism Lunch Menu™.”</p>
    <h3>Critics Are… Spiraling</h3>
    <p>Economists, ethicists, and your cousin who majored in philosophy are deeply confused. “We’ve officially entered the era of Monetized Morsels,” said Dr. Lila Grossman, who has been screaming into a compost bin since the press release dropped.</p>
    <p>One food justice advocate was quoted saying, “People can’t afford groceries and now we’re trading JPEGs of snacks?” while another simply said, “🫠.”</p>
    <h3>Still, The Numbers Are Ridiculous</h3>
    <p>A partially eaten Reuben sold for $87,000 after going viral on SandwichTok. One user flipped a digital bite of an egg salad croissant for a 600% profit after Elon Musk tweeted, “Kinda hungry now lol 🥪 #BAAS.”</p>
    <p>The market is hot, weird, and impossible to explain at dinner parties.</p>
    <h3>What You Should Do Right Now</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Take pictures of your lunch like it's stock in a startup</li>
      <li>Say “bite equity” with a straight face</li>
      <li>Claim your sandwich has historical value even if it’s from 7-Eleven</li>
      <li>Prepare to cry when you realize your real sandwich has no resale value</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Update: Meta Announces MetaMunch™—Full VR Sandwich Eating Experience</h3>
    <p>Next year, users will be able to simulate chewing on famous bites in the metaverse, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>JFK’s last pastrami</li>
      <li>Beyoncé’s Coachella grilled cheese</li>
      <li>And “The Existential Nibble,” a sourdough crust eaten in total silence by Steve Jobs in 2007</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At this point, we don’t know if the economy is collapsing or just evolving into a snack.</p>
    <p>Either way: get in while it’s crunchy.</p>
